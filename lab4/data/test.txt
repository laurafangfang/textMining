Police are responding to a incident in Phillipstown in Christchurch according to media reports.

According to NZ Herald cordons are in place and residents are being asked to avoid the Newcastle St area.

More to come.There are concerns for the safety of inmates at Hawke's Bay Regional Prison after a prisoner who was assaulted in the yard last year was unable to call for help.

Chief Ombudsman Peter Boshier recounted the incident in his findings, released today, after an unannounced inspection of the prison in November last year.

"Last year, my inspectors observed footage of a prisoner being assaulted by two prisoners in the high security yard.

"Although CCTV coverage was comprehensive, access to emergency call points within the yard was limited and the victim was unable to call for assistance.

"After the fights at Mount Eden in 2016, the Department of Correctionsâ€™ own Chief Inspector called for more active supervision of prisoners.

"Two years on, I am concerned that the safety of prisoners in the exercise yard continues to be solely monitored by CCTV," Mr Boshier says.

While he says the prison has also made "significant progress towards improving prisoner's safety", Mr Boshier says more can be done.

"Since my last inspection, three prisoners have died in the prison. One of these deaths occurred in March 2017 following staff using force to restrain the prisoner. I had called for the use of force at the prison to be reviewed after my last inspection, and I do so again."
