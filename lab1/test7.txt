Nicky Hager has claimed victory over Westpac after the bank settled and apologised in the face of claims it breached the journalists' privacy.
The settlement followed proceedings brought against the bank by the Human Rights Review Tribunal (HRRT) claiming information had been unlawfully released to Police.
In an statement released today Hager welcomed the development: "I was confident we were going to prevail before the HRRT, but that was likely to have been several years away. Westpac have done the right thing here by owning up to the breach and putting in place much better procedures to protect against it happening again," he said.
"This is an important victory for privacy in New Zealand. It will help many people."
The terms of the settlement include an apology from Westpac, and what Hager's lawyers described as a "significant tightening" of its policies allowing the release of private data.
In 2017 Privacy Commissioner John Edwards ruled the bank had breached Hager's privacy without any legal obligation to do so, knocking back Westpac claim during arguments that their clients' rights to privacy were waived in their terms in conditions.
Until the ruling the broad practice of banks' , not just Westpac, releasing financial information to Police and other agencies on request - without requiring a search warrant or other legal order - had been relatively commonplace.
Felix Geiringer, Hager's lawyers, said while Westpac's apology and change of policy "look good", the case had wider implications.
"But what about the other banks? ... Pressure need to continue on those other institutions until they implement terms like the ones announced today by Westpac," he said.
The settlement is the latest and possibly last step in sprawl of cases brought by Hager challenging Police over-steps in their investigation into the source for his book Dirty Politics.
