Spark boss Simon Moutter ribs new Sky TV CEO Martin Stewart - but there's a messy truth underneath
"Early days, but Sky TV's new boss seems promising," I tweeted last night.

"Promising apart from being a Chelsea supporter, that is."

Spark MD Simon Moutter shot back, "Which he will need to buy Spark Sport to watch them on later this year!!!"

Kym Niblock, CIO at Spark's free-to-air partner TVNZ, weighed in with some laughing-til-I-cry emojis.

It was all a good chuckle, but underneath the quips, there's an annoying truth for sports fans: for many codes, they'll have to buy both the $20/month Spark Sport plus a Sky Sport package to see all the action.

For English football, for example, Spark Sport has indeed grabbed rights to the Premier League for three years from June.

But Sky retains rights to almost everything else soccer related, from Euro 2020 to the FA Cup and the Uefa Champions League (which will feature the top four English Premier League teams) and the Uefa Europa Cup, where the fifth- and sixth-finishing EPL teams will play.

NBA fans, similarly, will soon find some US basketball coverage on Spark Sport, and some still on Sky.

And of course Sky Sport-subscribing rugby fans will have to sign on to Spark Sport to see the Rugby World Cup later this year - plus whatever other local rugby the telco signs up as it partners with NEP, the world's largest outside sports producer, which has recently set up shop in NZ.

And while competition is good, and will drive more content and viewing options for sports fans, it could also get more expensive still. In the UK, for example, football fans now need to subscribe to Amazon Prime, Sky UK and BT Sport to see all Premier League games.
